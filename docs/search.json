    "text": "üë®‚Äçüè´: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\nüìÖ: Asynchronous Online with Synchronous Check-Ins\nüìß: sbholt@albany.edu\nüè´: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book here; in-person in Milne 324 or online in GatherTown.1\n‚òéÔ∏è: 518-442-3309\n\n\n\nThe mission of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy Master of Public Administration (MPA) Program is to develop leaders, managers, and advanced analysts who excel in public service within government and across sectors. The MPA curriculum emphasizes the development of technical and managerial skills toward the responsible and ethical uses of discretion in the pursuit exemplary personal and organizational performance (see the appendix for a list of the competencies). The MPA‚Äôs mission and curriculum reflects the faculty‚Äôs commitment to producing committed and engaged public servants whose actions embody public service ideals.\nRPAD 507 ‚ÄúIntegrative Capstone‚Äù is the culmination of this learning process. As such, during this course, students will apply the competencies, knowledge, and skills they have acquired throughout the program to a semester-long case study project in a fictional setting. Course assignments will require students to synthesize and apply skills and material from across the MPA curriculum, individually and in teams.\n\n\nThe course materials will all be shared through the course Brightspace and this course site. The materials will generally be assignment instructions and helpful supplemental materials.\n\n\n\nAs a capstone class, this class is centered around two primary assignments:\n\nAn individual assignment to produce a segment of the analysis for the case study final report.\nA group assignment to produce a final report - a section of which will be drawn from the individual assignment.\n\nAs with all online courses, there is not a weekly meeting time and your group work will be conducted and coordinated with each other. However, unlike most online courses, this course is ensuring an application and synthesis of program skills and materials. As a result, there are not weekly modules. Instead, when the course transitions to the group assignment (March 1st), groups will be expected to meet with the instructor bi-weekly to provide a progress report on their capstone work. The final report will be developed in segments and the bi-weekly check-ins will ensure groups are on track and receive the advice and instruction they need. Groups will sign-up for 30 minute office hour blocks using the link in the header (or here). For any particular meeting, groups can either designate an attendee to bring the update to office hours and pass on feedback or attend as a group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an individual, students will write a 6 page (single spaced, 12 point Times New Roman font) stakeholder analysis based on the case study provided to the class. The assignment should open with a 1 page description of the budgetary decision being made and a 5 page stakeholder assessment of the important stakeholders to engage for the decision to be successful. The individual assignment will be due February 28th and details for completing the assignment will be provided on Brightspace and the course site during the first week of classes.\n\n\n\nThe group assignment will have four deliverables: 1) a group roles contract (details will be provided on Brightspace) submitted for instructor review (due March 8th); 2) an outline of the group‚Äôs approach to the case (due March 20th); 3) the final case study report (due May 4th); and 4) a group final presentation video, which can be done as a recorded Zoom with screenshare for slides and a polished presentation from all members (due May 4th).\n\n\n\nThe course grade consists of:\n\nStakeholder analysis (35%)\nFinal Report (35%)\n\nOutline (5%)\nContract (5%)\nPeer Evaluation (10%)\nReport (15%)\n\nFinal Presentation (15%)\nCompletion of Peer Evaluation (15%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nAssignment\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n4/28\nStakeholder Analysis Due\n\n\n\n3/8\nGroup Roles Contract Due\n\n\n\n3/7 or 3/9\nFirst Group Check-In\n\n\n\n3/20\n1-page outline of group appraoch\n\n\n\n4/4 or 4/6\nSecond Group Check-In\n\n\n\n4/18 or 4/20\nFinal Group Check-In\n\n\n\n5/4\nFinal Report and Final Presentation Due\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNOTE: I will be adding materials to both the Brightspace and the Course site on working in groups, delivering presentations, and the expectations for the final report. I will post announcements to the class when such updates and materials are posted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\nLetters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\nI have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\nHAVE FUN! Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\nThe table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\nStudents with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNOTE: Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n\n\nTable.

Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university‚Äôs academic honesty policies, visit the site.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment. Once you have completed registration, you will be provided with a letter to inform your instructors that you are a student with a disability registered with DAISS, and which lists the recommended reasonable accommodations for your courses.\n\n\n\nThe Counseling Center (518-442-5800; 400 Patroon Creek Blvd, Suite 104) offers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus resources. More information can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nSUNY-Albany offers a great collection available in several different media. Access to research help and library tutorials can be found online at the library‚Äôs site.\nFor information about SUNY-Albany‚Äôs Dewey Graduate Library, which is located on the Downtown Campus, visit their site.\n\n\n\nThe university offers a number of services for students who need assistance with writing and research projects. Support is available in the Writing Center (518-442-4061; 140 HU) and at the University Library. Information about the Writing Center can be found at their site.\n\n\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities. The University at Albany provides a variety of resources for support and advocacy to assist individuals who have experienced sexual offenses.\nConfidential support and guidance can be found through the Counseling Center (518-442-5800, or online), the University Health Center (518-442-5454, or online), and the Interfaith Center (518-489-8573, or online). Individuals at these locations will not report crimes to law enforcement or university officials without permission, except for in extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. Additionally, the Advocates at the University at Albany‚Äôs Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence are available to assist students without sharing information that could identify them (518-442-CARE, or online).\nSexual offenses can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Equity and Compliance (518-442-3800, or online, Building 25, Room 117) and/or the University Police Department (518-442-3131, or online).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Faculty members are considered ‚Äúresponsible employees‚Äù at the University at Albany, meaning that they are required to report all known relevant details about a complaint of sexual violence to the University‚Äôs Title IX Coordinator, including names of anyone involved or present, date, time, and location.\n\n\nIn case of an emergency, please call 911.\n\n\n\nA tentative grade given only when the student has nearly completed the course but due to circumstances beyond the student‚Äôs control the work is not completed on schedule. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MPA graduate from Rockefeller College will be able to energize people and resources in the pursuit of publically defined policy goals in a manner that respects multiple perspectives and recognizes consequences of their actions.\nWithin organizations, our MPA graduates will:\n\nDemonstrate leadership in personal work and group settings.\nPrioritize activities in a manner consistent with organizational strategy and performance goals, regardless of their position in the hierarchy.\nFacilitate, plan, and manage projects to meet organizational goals.\n\nTo those outside of their organizations, our MPA graduates will:\n\nDisplay responsible stewardship of public resources and accountability to the public interest.\nCoordinate actions with multiple organizations.\nNavigate the competing interests of other governmental and non-governmental actors.\n\n\n\n\nAn MPA graduate from Rockefeller College will substantively participate in the design, implementation, and evaluation of public policy.

    "text": "You are the Director of the Parks Department for Stratton County, a metropolitan county in upstate New York. Due to economic conditions and increasing costs, the County Executive has directed all departments, including Parks, to develop plans to cut next year‚Äôs operating budget by 10% from the current level. Under the County‚Äôs budget development calendar, executive agencies begin to develop their budget priorities for the upcoming year in early February and submit their proposals to the County Executive‚Äôs office in early May. By law, the County Executive must submit his or her budget recommendation to the County Legislature by August 15th, for review (including at least one public hearing) and adoption prior to the start of the new fiscal year on September 1st. For the purposes of this assignment, you are delivering your recommendations as a report and presentation on May 4th. Of course, before generating a final report and set of recommendations, your agency will of course want to touch base with the community to get feedback and thoughts on your plan for the budget reductions. For this assignment - due on February 28th - you will be creating a proposed set of budget changes, identifying important stakeholders for engagement, and developing a plan for engaging stakeholders. You will be drawing on the case detailed in Stratton County."

    "title": "Individual Assignment",
    "section": "Details",
    "text": "Details\nYour submission will involve three sections: a 1-page memo outlining your budget proposal, a 2-page summary of the major stakeholders that will be relevant to the budget decisions you‚Äôve made, and a 3-page summary of how you will engage your stakeholders.\n\nBudget Memo\nIn your one page budget memo, you need to briefly and precisely establish two things. First, you need to outline where all of the cuts to the operating budget will be coming from and how you anticipate services to be impacted. Second, you need to explain why those areas were identified for reduction. Note that if you make any other accompanying changes to the budget, those should include those in this memo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Budget Creativity\n\n\n\nWhile budgets are not often thought of as expressions of high art, as you have hopefully learned throughout your time here, there is room for creativity in public budgeting. When making decisions, note that it‚Äôs possible to reduce some areas more than necessary and use the additional reduction to invest new resources somewhere else even in a time of overall budget reductions. Just a useful (though not required or always needed) tool to keep in mind.\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Analysis\nIn RPAD 500 (Foundations of Public Administration), you almost certainly read the Eden and Ackermann (1998) chapter on stakeholder analysis. Here, you will once again be thinking about stakeholders using their framework - identify the four most important stakeholders given your budget proposal while considering their power to raise opposition or support to your efforts and their interest in the outcome of the final budget. In your analysis, be sure to detail the basis on which you are assessing each stakeholder‚Äôs power and interest and whether they will be opponents or supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile this is based on a fictional case, remember that it was designed on real-world cases. When considering stakeholders‚Äô power and interest, do some research to ground your assessments. In similar budget situations, who tends to be most vocal and powerful according to research? How do similar groups behave or react in similar situations in other cities? What typically gets their support? A good analysis will ground itself in concrete measures and ways to think critically about the world.\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nAlso in RPAD 500, you likely read Fung (2003) and created a plan for engaging stakeholders before. In this assignment, you will once again be rolling out a plan for engaging your stakeholders. You will provide details about a schedule of meetings, outreach, a timeline for feedback and how feedback will be used, where and when meetings will be held, and how those meetings will be structured. More importantly, you will need to link this plan and its details to your budget goals and analysis of your stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Strategic Engagement\n\n\n\nOne way to ensure productive engagement is to have a plan going in for how you will handle opposition. Identify some aspects of your budget proposal that are negotiable without activating too much opposition elsewhere. Another important aspect of strategy is clarifying and articulating what you hope to get out of the engagement. Is this collecting feedback or trying to bring awareness and context to a decision? Your approach should align with what you hope to get out of the engagement."

    "text": "Stratton County‚Äôs current population totals 325,000 people and includes two major population centers, the City of Stratford (population 65,000) and the City of Ogden Mills (population 120,000). Stratford, the county seat, founded in 1731, is a flourishing historic city. Ogden Mills, founded in 1875, is a blighted and aging 19th century industrial mill town, the former home of the Ogden Works (abandoned in 1971). The two population centers are separated by the suburban towns of East Ogden and West Stratford, along the scenic Stratton River Valley. The county has five other surrounding towns that are more rural in character. Stratton County is governed by an elected County Executive and a 16-member County Legislature (representing 16 proportional legislative districts). The current County Executive was first elected to a four-year term in 2018.\nToday is January 25th, 2023. The County Executive is developing a plan to reduce the County‚Äôs operating budget in the coming fiscal year (which begins September 1st) and has directed all County departments and agencies to submit plans for the 2023 budget which will cut departmental operating budgets by 10% from current (2022) authorized levels, while absorbing any contractually-mandated increases and maintaining county revenues. The County Executive is required by law to submit the Executive Budget proposal to the County Legislature for its consideration by August 15th.\nIn addition to calling for plans to reduce departmental operating budgets by 10% in the upcoming year, the County Executive‚Äôs January 15th directive to all department heads highlighted the following:\n\n‚ÄúWe face significant fiscal pressure due to rising health care and pension costs, continued erosion of private sector jobs, and increasing human service and related needs‚Äù; and\n‚ÄúAs agencies develop plans to cut budgets by 10%, all are directed to balance three specific goals for the coming year:\n\nKeep costs down,\nLower taxes, and\nStrategically invest in the future of Stratton County.‚Äù\n\n\nOver the past two weeks, excerpts of this directive have been published in the local media and on the county website, generating considerable commentary in print, on-line and among elected officials, community activists, and the public.\nThe Stratton County Parks Department began its internal budget development process (for 2023) in early August. This included a series of internal meetings with park superintendents and key staff and an internal assessment of needs and issues facing the department in the coming year. Additional in-house (department-level) meetings have been held following the January 15th directive."

    "text": "Background Information on Stratton County Parks\nThe Stratton County Parks Department is a cabinet-level unit of county government, with the Director of Parks (you) reporting directly to the County Executive. The county has five major parks and hosts 450,000 visitors annually. The agency‚Äôs current budget totals $2.70 million including 20 year-round (annual) staff positions, supplemented with part-time and temporary (hourly) staff on a seasonal basis.\nIn 2020, Stratton County received a state ‚Äú2025 Vision‚Äù grant to update its parks and recreation and community development plans. A consulting firm was engaged to assist in the development of the plan, a community-based advisory board was established, and 15 public stakeholder meetings were held at various locations in the county over the ensuing year. In October 2021, the final plan was completed and accepted by the then County Executive (who has since left office). The parks portion of the plan identified five policy priorities for Stratton County Parks:\n\nAccess to All: ‚ÄúParks are community assets and support social equity and inclusion. Parks and park programs should be available, affordable and accessible to all county residents, regardless of age, ability, or economic status.‚Äù\nHealth and Wellness: ‚ÄúParks provide opportunities for active and passive recreation and promote community health, mental health and the well-being of county residents.‚Äù\nConservation: ‚ÄúParks preserve and protect important natural, cultural and historic resources, which are held in trust for future generations.‚Äù\nCommunity Development: ‚ÄúParks promote the well-being of communities, supporting education, economic development, and the growth and revitalization of communities.‚Äù\nProgress and Prosperity: ‚ÄúParks are important community-owned assets which should be leveraged to promote community growth and economic progress, job creation, and community identity and prosperity.‚Äù\n\nOriginally established under the grant guidelines, the Parks Community Advisory Board (PCAB) was formalized in 2021. Current members of the PCAB include the husband of the mayor of Ogden Mills (who is also a partner in a downtown Stratford law firm), the CEO of the Consolidated Boys and Girls Clubs of Stratton County, the President of the Stratton Valley Hiking Club, the outdoor editor of the local newspaper the Stratford Herald, the vice-chair of the Stratford-Ogden Youth Soccer Association, and a ‚Äúuser representative‚Äù from each of the County‚Äôs five major parks. The grant also requires that the PCAB meet at least annually (last year‚Äôs meeting was held in mid-November) and that the County submit a five-year progress report to the state (which is due by October 31st, 2023).\nThe Stratton County Park system has five major parks (see map).\n\nOgden Falls County Park\n\nBackground\nOgden Falls is the county‚Äôs newest county park, opening in 1980. It is located in the Stratton Shores neighborhood in the city of Ogden Mills on the site of an abandoned amusement park and adjacent to the former Ogden Works industrial lands (located at the site of the historic water wheel that powered the mills in the 19th century). The park‚Äôs original development was part of a multi-million dollar federal-state-local ‚ÄúCommunity Revitalization‚Äù project, creating a new public park (including a large public swimming pool, skating rink, running track, tennis and basketball courts, play areas and athletic fields, and waterfront esplanade), redevelopment of the adjacent former mill buildings into a retail complex, the development of affordable housing, and new streets, landscaping, and sidewalks. Now, over 40 years later, the park is showing its age from overuse and lack of ongoing maintenance. Play areas, the swimming pool (and associated mechanical systems), athletic fields, and bathrooms are all in dire need of rehabilitation. Over the last decade, the neighborhood surrounding the park has declined, as well; the retail shops are nearly empty and the area has one of the highest crime rates and students in the neighborhood exhibit the lowest high school graduation rates in the county. Recent press stories describing gang activities taking place in the surrounding neighborhood are leading many residents to feel the park may be unsafe. Despite all of that, community residents rely on the park for green space. Its picnic and lawn areas, playground and basketball courts are in almost constant use and neighborhood children look forward to the pool‚Äôs opening each summer. Even with its many challenges, the park remains the heart of the community. The newly re-elected (in 2021) Mayor of Ogden Mills campaigned on a theme of revitalizing the city and redeveloping the Stratton Shores neighborhood adjacent to the park. The current Mayor formerly was the City Council member representing the Stratton Shores neighborhood, and the revitalization is high on her to-do list.\n\n\nCurrent Issues\nThe Assistant Park Superintendent position for Ogden Falls is currently vacant as the incumbent has been temporarily reassigned to the Stratton Valley Golf Course (note: the position is budgeted for in the current year, even though it is not filled). As the park is currently entering its ‚Äúoff season‚Äù (with the start of the new school year), the temporary loss of this essential position is not critical‚Äîbut the position should be refilled before next spring. As part of the agency‚Äôs internal 2023 budget development process, the park‚Äôs Superintendent also has requested the addition of a full-time Ranger ($50,000 for salary and benefits) in the coming year to provide security at the park in the evening hours, year round, as the ability of the County Sheriff‚Äôs patrols to provide coverage is limited. Another concern is that permits for the best usage times for the tennis courts, skating rink and the athletic fields have been awarded to various organizations (both nonprofits and various business-oriented leagues) for use by their members and clients ‚Äì at the exclusion of ‚Äúdrop-in‚Äù use by neighborhood residents. Reversing this policy and providing more ‚Äúopen community time‚Äù would be desirable, but would both cost the county approximately $25,000 in permit revenue, and require $20,000 in increased seasonal staffing for supervision and $10,000 in associated materials costs. In addition, this past July the state Labor Department (in response to anonymous employee complaints) has recently conducted a safety inspection of the park and has identified numerous violations, including the unsafe storage and inadequate ventilation of hazardous chemicals, improper workplace practices and deficient employee safety training; remedying the hazardous materials storage violations alone will cost the park $25,000 in the upcoming year.\n\n\n\nBonavista Reserve\n\nBackground\nThe Bonavista Reserve is located on the site of the former Winthrop Arlington Ogden estate, in a rural area of Stratton County. The land was given to the county for use as ‚Äúa public playground and natural reserve in perpetuity‚Äù by the Ogden family in 1921. The park has panoramic views of the Stratton River Valley, extensive nature and hiking trails, ornamental gardens, numerous natural ponds, and wetlands. A small nature center and museum was opened in 2011 after an extensive private fundraising effort, led by the park‚Äôs nonprofit Friends of Bonavista Reserve. The park is a favorite for school groups and has an award-winning nature trail.\n\n\nCurrent Issues\nNewly-adopted state educational standards require that all 3rd and 4th grade science students receive hands-on (field) environmental education instruction as part of their science curriculum. This change has significantly impacted operations at the Reserve. School group bookings have doubled in the past year and, at times, the small nature center has been filled beyond capacity with teachers and students. There aren‚Äôt enough trained environmental educators on staff (an additional $20,000 in seasonal staffing would be needed to meet current demand), the nature center‚Äôs exhibits and collections of ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù materials should be replaced (which will cost $25,000). Also, the Reserve‚Äôs museum and network of nature trails need to be upgraded to be able to meet new accessibility standards in order to properly serve disabled students. Without these upgrades, school groups may stop coming to the park. The cost to upgrade the accessibility of the nature trails and museum is estimated at $50,000. The President of the Friends of Bonavista Reserve has conducted extensive research into potential funding opportunities and has identified a proposed new competitive federal grant program called ‚ÄúGet Kids Outside‚Äù; that program is not funded in the current federal budget and, at best, funds will not be available for at least 18 to 24 months. The Friends of Bonavista Reserve is organizing a petition drive and has scheduled a park tour by the local Congressional representative in the coming weeks. There has been discussion about including this in the Capital Budget discussion for next year (which occurs at a different time), but some are worried that delaying accessibility improvements will cause students to stop attending the park before a capital project would begin.\n\n\n\nStratton Valley Golf Course\n\nBackground\nThe original members of the Stratton Valley Country Club (SVCC), located in West Stratford, were the ‚Äúexecutive class‚Äù of the Ogden Works and related businesses when the industrial age was booming in Stratton County. As industry declined, so did SVCC and it was converted into a privately-owned ‚Äúdaily play‚Äù course in the 1970s. The county purchased it and opened it as a public golf course in 1977. The Stratton Valley Golf Course is county-operated, with county employees providing for operations and maintenance. A private concessionaire (StratLinks, LLC, a locally-owned business) operates the pro shop and the clubhouse restaurant under a contractual (ten year) lease, under parkland alienation legislation, paying a commission to the County of 15% of all income received from restaurant and pro shop sales, lessons, and related services. This contract expires December 31st, 2022. Five years ago, the Stratton Business Association campaigned to have all golf course operations fully privatized and three years ago the county chose to incrementally privatize revenue collection operations (only) at the course by expanding and amending the StratLinks agreement. Under that amended agreement, StratLinks is paid a $25,000 service fee annually to collect greens fees at the course and all revenues collected are deposited daily directly into County accounts. Since becoming a county park, Stratton Valley consistently has been ranked as one of the top 25 ‚Äúmost affordable‚Äù public golf courses in the state. Greens fees were raised in 1985, 1999 and again in 2007.\n\n\nCurrent Issues\nLast year the course experienced a significant public scandal when a state audit revealed that the course Superintendent (a county employee) received gifts, free meals, and other benefits from a local golf equipment shop owner (a former business partner of the current StratLinks owner) who was allowed to use the public course for clinics, equipment demonstrations, and private outings, without going through the normal permit and bidding process. The audit also found (but could not explain) that revenue collections from green fees at the course declined from $425,000 in 2020 to $400,000 last year. Following the release of the audit last spring, the Superintendent retired and has been temporarily replaced by reassignment of the former Assistant Superintendent at Ogden Falls. The existing Assistant Superintendent at Stratton Valley remains as the park‚Äôs #2, but is under an ongoing ‚Äúcloud of suspicion‚Äù from the scandal. He has let it be known (unofficially) that if he is not promoted to a Superintendent‚Äôs position, he also will retire early next year. The audit and resulting scandal have brought renewed calls by some to fully privatize the course in order to ‚Äúclear up this mess.‚Äù In addition to filling the Superintendent‚Äôs position (with either candidate), the golf course is in need of additional mowing equipment to replace a 15-year old tractor mower. Since this is specific to the golf course and is not a capital improvement, you have been told it needs to be in the operating budget and not the capital budget (if included at all). A new $50,000 mower would reduce mowing time by 25% (saving an estimated $25,000 in staff time) and would reduce equipment repair costs by $15,000 annually (starting in 2023).\n\n\n\nTwin Lakes County Park\n\nBackground\nTwin Lakes County Park, located in East Ogden, is the county‚Äôs most popular park, with two lakes, a large swimming beach and bathhouse complex, five reservable picnic pavilions, picnic areas, boat rentals, and a soccer field complex. Twin Lakes caters to a largely suburban audience, being located outside the service area of the County‚Äôs public-transportation system reachable only by car. The park was recognized in 2018 as a ‚ÄúGold Medal‚Äù park by the National Recreation and Park Association, in part due to the County‚Äôs investment in the community soccer program. Park staff are currently implementing a five-year plan to achieve ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù recognition in 2023, which would make it the first ‚ÄúPlatinum Medal‚Äù county park in the state.\n\n\nCurrent Issues\nTwin Lakes is regarded as Stratton County‚Äôs ‚Äúbackyard park‚Äù as it is located in the most suburban part of the county. The school boards, administrators, and athletic departments from both West Stratford and East Ogden school districts have approached the park‚Äôs superintendent with a plan to develop an annual ‚ÄúFamily Fun and Fitness Festival‚Äù to encourage exercise, outdoor activities and combat childhood obesity. This group also has approached members of the Parks Community Advisory Board in support of funding for the festival in next year‚Äôs budget. The Festival would be held in mid-September to coincide with the opening of school. For the park, events that communicate the message that ‚Äúoutdoor activity doesn‚Äôt stop after Labor Day‚Äù would also help to boost park visitation in the fall and winter months. The two-day event would include a 5K race and fun run, instruction in kayaking, a bike rodeo, a three-on-three youth basketball tournament, and other activities. Additional staff would need to be brought on for the weekend, recreational equipment and supplies would need to be purchased, portable toilets would have to be rented, and contracts would need to be let for activity leaders, instructors, and referees‚Äîat a total cost of $27,500.\n\n\n\nStratford Green and Courthouse Square Parks\n\nBackground\nStratford Green is a large, Victorian-era urban park located in the heart of the City of Stratford, with 78 acres of lawns and ornamental plantings, fountains, a band shell and a small lake. Five years ago, as part of a ‚Äúgovernment efficiency initiative‚Äù by the then County Executive, jurisdiction of Stratford Green was transferred from the City of Stratford to Stratton County. Management of Stratford Green was combined with the smaller (5 acre), adjacent county-owned and operated Courthouse Square Park. This transfer has substantially benefitted city taxpayers and business-owners in the forms of reduced operating costs and taxes. Security at the two-park complex has been an area of conflict between the City of Stratford (which had been responsible for Stratford Green) and the County Sheriff (which has always been responsible for Courthouse Square), especially when there are large public events requiring additional police presence. The current County Executive, elected to a four-year term in 2018, opposed the transfer of the park from the city to the county as a member of the County Legislature representing suburban East Ogden.\n\n\nCurrent Issues\nThe most beloved features of Courthouse Square Park are the ‚ÄúUnion Oaks‚Äù, two trees planted in 1875 to commemorate the end of the Civil War. The trees are planted about 100 feet apart and the area between them is currently a brick-paved courtyard, a popular place for community gatherings (and for county office building and courthouse employees to eat lunch!). The 140+ year-old trees are failing from neglect; last winter a large limb fell following an ice storm, damaging the courtyard‚Äôs ornamental fountain. A recent private study commissioned by a concerned citizens group, The Campaign to Save the Union Oaks, has recommended that the county contract with a certified professional arborist to ‚Äúsave the trees‚Äù and to remove the paved-over courtyard and replace it with a lawn and gardens. The cost of an arborist on-contract will cost an additional $50,000 annually (for at least 3-5 years) and the estimated cost to remove and relocate the courtyard and create a new garden area is $350,000. This would be funded from county Capital Improvement funds or funds that will have to be raised largely from grants or from private or other sources (or some combination). The Stratford Herald, the regional daily newspaper, has recently editorialized in favor of the campaign to save the Union Oaks, calling the potential loss of the historic trees, if it happens, ‚Äúa potent symbol of government incompetence and neglect.‚Äù In addition, the County Sheriff already has notified the Parks Department that it plans to reduce security patrols at Stratford Green and Courthouse Square in 2023 as part of its 10% reduction plan; this action, if approved, would save the Sheriff‚Äôs department $50,000 annually (and would cost the Parks department a like amount simply to maintain park security at current levels)."

Previously, the Department‚Äôs central office also had a Special Programs Coordinator, who was responsible for staff training, coordination of volunteers, intergovernmental relations, grant-writing and working with community and affiliated organizations. That person retired 18 months ago and the position has not been filled, nor has the Director requested re-filling this position.\n\n\nCurrent Issues\nThe retired former Special Programs Coordinator has continued to provide critical staff training on a part-time basis, as well as grants-related research, at a part-time salary of $25,000 annually, including benefits. Training includes mandatory sexual harassment prevention, mandatory workplace health and safety for all annual and seasonal employees on an annual basis, as well as job-related customer service and job skills training for all staff. Last month, a taxpayer group published in a blog a list of retired county employees receiving a public pension who had returned to salaried positions (so called ‚Äúdouble-dippers‚Äù), including this individual. In reaction, the County Executive directed that all such arrangements be discontinued as of next January 1 (2024). Replacing this position with a private contractor is estimated to cost $35,000 next year."

    "section": "Additional Budget Information",
    "text": "Additional Budget Information\n\nCurrent and Requested Budgets\nThe current fiscal year annual operating budget for the Parks Department totals $2,704,000. Therefore, the budget plan to be submitted for next year cannot exceed $2,433,600, reflecting a 10% reduction from the current level. The current annual operating budget, current staffing, and requested budget amounts for each park are summarized in the spreadsheet posted on Blackboard along with background data on revenue collection from user fees and contract payments and visitor profiles for each park.\nUnder the current county budget, all earned revenues collected in the parks are transferred to the General Operating Fund and are not earmarked specifically for Park use; rather, they become part of a large pool of funds that is subject to the normal County budgeting process. The General Operating Fund is used by the County to fund all of its operations, not just the Parks, and you must at least maintain current levels. Any proceeds from grants or from nonprofit and private fundraising are kept in the Parks Department and may be used to offset up to 2% of the cuts; in other words, if you can reasonably raise $54,080 from philanthropy, you can reduce the budget to not more than $2,487,680 (but be sure to mention in the report and presentation how this benefits the county.) Grants and donations can only be used for specific projects and are not available for general operating support.\n\n\nCapital Improvement Plan\nStratton County also has a centralized Capital Budget, which is managed by the county‚Äôs Engineering Services Division of the Department of Public Works. The Consolidated County Capital Budget funds longer-term investments in building and facilities, land, infrastructure and fixed equipment for county government. The Consolidated County Capital Budget includes allocations for projects on behalf of the various county departments. Capital funds are not included in departmental budgets. Stratton County follows a rolling capital planning process. Each March, specific capital projects are identified by each department for possible inclusion in the County Budget for the following year. These are placed on a ‚Äúpre-approved‚Äù planning list. This step allows potential projects to undergo planning, engineering and other reviews before they are formally authorized in the annual budget (for the fiscal year beginning in January). The total cost of projects included on this preliminary ‚Äúplanning list‚Äù typically exceeds the funding amounts anticipated for the upcoming year in order to provide flexibility. Based on funding available and capital investment priorities, any of these ‚Äúpre-approved‚Äù projects that are not funded in the subsequent year‚Äôs budget go back into the queue for the following year.\nEach item on the ‚Äúpre-approved‚Äù Planning List represents a specific priority capital project that has undergone some degree of preliminary engineering design and cost estimation. The capital allocation in the current (2022) budget for the Parks Department totals $500,000. As it is August, these projects are already underway. The current, preliminary ‚Äúpre-approved‚Äù 2023 planning list for Parks, developed last March, stands at $750,000, and is summarized by park below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Budget (2022 Approved)\nPlanning List (2023 Pre-Approved)\n\n\n\n\nOgden Falls\n$150,000\n$375,000\n\n\nBonavista Reserve\n$150,000\n$50,000\n\n\nStratton Valley GC\n$50,000\n$75,000\n\n\nTwin Lakes\n$100,000\n$200,000\n\n\nStratford Green/Courthouse Sq.\n$50,000\n$50,000\n\n\n\nPlease note that the above Planning List amounts by park projects reflect specific project needs identified more than six months ago and do not reflect ‚Äúcurrent issues‚Äù identified in the Parks Department‚Äôs 2023 budget development process. It is expected that the level of capital funding for 2024 will be consistent with the current budget but the specific projects to be funded for 2024 have not yet been finalized. As capital improvement funds are not part of the Parks Department‚Äôs operating budget, any proposed reductions in capital spending for Parks may not be used to offset required cuts to the Department‚Äôs operating budget in the coming year. However, in principle, requests for funding for larger, long-term capital improvement projects can be made through the Capital Improvement Plan, though with a large degree of uncertainty and longer timeline."

    "section": "Collective Bargaining Agreements",
    "text": "Collective Bargaining Agreements\nAll Parks employees are represented by public employee unions (except for the Director of Parks). Union contracts currently in force on a county-wide basis include the following provisions:\n\n2.5% salary increases in the form of cost-of-living salary adjustments (COLAs) for all employees (and positions), annual and seasonal, effective January 1, 2023.\nNo layoffs of existing annual staff due until expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement on December 31st 2023. Annual-salaried employees (and their positions) may be eliminated (laid off) only as a result of the closure of facilities and elimination of programs, which must be specified as part of the adopted budget.\nCounty employees covered by collective bargaining may be transferred between physical work locations (facilities or departments) on an involuntary basis only upon 90 days‚Äô notice and posting of a ‚Äúnotice of transfer‚Äù list which seeks to identify employees wishing to transfer on a voluntary basis. If two or more employees request a transfer of location, the determination of which employee to transfer must be made on the basis of seniority (defined as the length of county employment). Employees may be temporarily reassigned involuntarily only up to 90 days, in order to meet emergency and other program and workload priorities. This may be extended by management up to an additional 90 days.\nSeasonal employees of the Parks Department are considered to be temporary and, technically, are terminated and rehired from year-to-year. Their employment is not guaranteed from year-to-year, and they are not restricted to a particular park location within that year. This is why the distribution of their hours across parks was even for the current budget (including Stratton Valley, whose budget includes an additional $25,000 for the StratLinks contract.)\nUnilateral layoffs of staff or reductions in salary and benefits are not permitted under the County-wide collective bargaining process with employee unions. Recent court cases strictly prohibit the County or any of its departments from unilaterally altering the terms of existing union contracts."

However, this time, you and your team are expected to prepare a complete report that provides the County Executive 3 alternative plans for cuts, an comparitive analysis of the 3 plans, and a final recommendation. You will draw on the same Stratton County case case details to inform and prepare your report. For this assignment, you will prepare a report of no more than 20 pages providing background research on effectively managing budget cuts, preparing 3 budget proposals to accommodate the needed cuts, preparing a stakeholder analysis and engagement plan for each proposal, conducting a comparitive analysis, and making a final recommendation. The report and a video presentation summarizing the report will be due by May 4th, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA reminder that by law, the County Executive must submit his or her budget recommendation to the County Legislature by August 15th, for review (including at least one public hearing) and adoption prior to the start of the new fiscal year on September 1st."

    "section": "Details",
    "text": "Details\nThis section lays out the sections that should be included in your 20 page (or less) report plus a one-page executive summary, in order, with details on expectations for each section. Overall, the format should use APA citation formatting (for both in-text citations and references list), 12-point Times New Roman font, and single-spaced. The first page should be a cover sheet with a title and all group member names clearly printed.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis section does not count toward your page count. The report must include a 1-page, single-spaced summary of the full report. The summary should lay out the problem, guiding principles for the solution, the three alternative approaches considered, and finally, the final recommendation. Be clear and concise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMany students find summarizing their extended research in a limited space challenging, but such summarizing is an important skill to build. A big part of being prepared in a professional role is doing all the work to get to your answer, knowing how you got to your answer well enough to answer clarifying questions, and identifying for yourself and others what is truly important for making a particular decision. Remember that in this context, there‚Äôs a full report detailing your process and thinking that will follow the summary; it‚Äôs okay for the summary to leave details out to get to the bottom-line points.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nA 1-2 page introduction that should resemble the executive summary, but with added details on how you approached the problem and how the remainder of the report is structured. A good introduction should provide readers a clear understanding of how you are defining the problem, how you are proposing to resolve the problem, how you are weighing solutions, and the process by which you analyzed your options. Note that professional reports are not mystery novels - readers should know your final conclusion by the end of the introduction.\n\n\nBackground and Related Research\nA 4-6 page summary of research that informs your decision-making. Your research should center on what the evidence says about managing cutbacks and budget reductions, what has been successful in similar cases in other areas, and any evidence that informs the approach(es) you are using in your management of the cutbacks. Do not quote articles or materials directly. Instead, summarize the literature in your own words with citations to works appropriately placed throughout the text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip - Research Basics\n\n\n\nA good approach to doing the background research is to create a list of broad, general search terms that inform the basic themes of what you are doing (in this case, ‚Äúbudget cuts,‚Äù ‚Äúcutback management,‚Äù ‚Äúcontracting,‚Äù ‚Äúlayoffs,‚Äù and ‚Äúcollective bargaining agreements‚Äù are all reasonable potential starting terms). Once you have your list, use it to search in premier academic journals on the topics (JPAM, PAR, JPART, ROPPA, APSR and PMR are good outlets for this assignment) and in GAO, CRS, and CBO reports to cast a wide net of potential information. I recommend searching directly at the journal‚Äôs websites or, in GoogleScholar, type the search term then add source:‚ÄúJournal Title‚Äù to the search. I recommend using year filters in Google Scholar to get both older and newer research on the subject. Read the abstracts and executive summaries to think about even a loose fit with what you are doing to narrow the number of papers to what‚Äôs most relevant. Now you have a collection of literature to draw on for informing your background section.\n\n\n\n\nProposals Considered\nThis section will include subsections for each of the three alternative proposals for dealing with the cuts that were analyzed and considered by your team. Each proposal should be 3-4 pages and should include 1) an overview and justification of the plan, 2) a short overview of the cuts, 3) a stakeholder analysis of those affected, and 4) a timeline and plan for engaging stakeholders. You may use no more than 3 tables, in text, in each proposal subsection. Tables should fit on one page, include a title above them, and be discussed in the text to aid reader understanding and complement the proposal narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEach of you has completed an individual assignment that largely reflected the pieces required of the alternative proposals section. Unless all of you have taken the exact same approach in your individual assignments, it is entirely appropriate and encouraged for you to adopt an edited, polished, and more concise version of your individual assignment as subsections here. You will want to not only revise for space constraints, but also revise for tone, voice, and narrative flow with the rest of the report. You may also, through discussion with one another, make tweaks to the plan.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the Trade-offs and Recommendation\nThe final section will be a 3-5 page analysis of the three plans in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and political impact of each plan leading to your final recommendation. As with the background and related research section, this section should include some research on how to define and measure these dimensions of each plan and anchor your recommendation in how each plan compares on these four dimensions. In the introduction, the goals and priorities driving your management of the parks department (and thereby influencing your budgetary priorities) should have been articulated clearly and will help you gauge each proposed alternative budget plan against those goals and priorities."

    "text": "Roles and Responsibilities\nAs with any team project, it is helpful to have clear roles and responsibilities in completing the project. Below is a table of roles and responsibilities that each group will need to assign. Each group should plan on exchanging individual assignments with one another to inform group discussion on which plans (or pieces of plans) should be incorporated as part of the three alternative proposals considered in the assignment. I also highly recommend groups assigning the editing role to who they believe to be a strong writer in the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\nResponsibility\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction, Executive Summary, and Editor\nWrite the Executive Summary and Introduction.  Suggest edits and revisions to other sections strictly for flow and cohesion.  Edit and provide one of the three proposed plans.\n\n\nBackground and Related Research\nWrite the background and related research section.  Edit and provide one of the three proposed plans (if relevant).\n\n\nAnalysis and Recommendation\nWrite the analysis and recommendation section.  Edit and provide one of the three proposed plans (if relevant).\n\n\nOne Proposed Plan\nEdit and provide on of the three proposed plans.  Aid with finding and organizing background research for the background and analysis sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs there are only 3 alternative plans needed and groups will have 4 members, one person will have their individual plan excluded. The author of the plan from the individual assignments that the group decides is either too similar to other plans or too different from other collectively decided goals or objectives to be included in the full report should take on either the background section or the analysis section. Thus, ‚Äú(if relevant)‚Äù above suggests that one of these roles may not have an alternative budget plan slated for revision and inclusion in the final report. This should never be taken as a suggestion of quality, but instead one of fit.\n\n\nTeams should plan to meet to assign roles, sign the group role contract, and submit the signed contract on Brightspace by midnight on March 8th."
